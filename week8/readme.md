# DSA Week8 Lab assignment
Linear sata structures, sorting, and searching algorithms review 
## Instructions

* Make a Linear Data Structure with pointers or array (your choice) and make sure it works and can accept many elements.

* Then with the elements inserted into the Data Structure, make sure to perform Binary Search on the dataset. ( Make sure to sort beforehand!!)

* The sorting can be done with the bubble sort algorithm or you can use another sorting algorithm. 

## Details
### Program 
* Linear Data Structure : Queue with array implementation 
* Sorting algorithm: merge sort 
    * **time complexity**: O(N log(N))
        * number of levels ->log(N) base 2 
        * nuber of operations performed on each level -> N 
        * product = N log(N)

    * **space complexity** : O(n)
        * auxilliary array needed to store elements in sorted order
