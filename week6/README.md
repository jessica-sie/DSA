### Week 6 forum assignment 
converting infix to postfix notation with recursion and iteration

##### Base Case 
stops the recrusion 
 => when increment is equal to the length of the infix notation - 1
 AKA 
 if current character we are 'looking' at is at the end of the string 

##### General Case 
get to the base case
<<<<<<< HEAD
=> since the recursive function does not need to return any value, this recursion does not have a general case

only a set of algorithm runs for each character in the infix notation
